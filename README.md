# HotDog!

Multi-platform Rust-based app based on [Dioxus Tutorial](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/guide/).


## Serving Your App

Run the following command in the root of your project to start developing with the default platform:

```bash
dx serve
```

To run for a different platform, use the `--platform platform` flag. E.g.
```bash
dx serve --platform desktop
```
